The sample program provided will cover every element based on the ANTLR4 grammar.

At the very start of the code, there is a multi-lined comment section which briefly introduces
the reader to the high-level programming language NovaLingua. It is enclosed by a forward-slash
followed by an asterisk "/*" and an asterisk followed by a forward-slash "*/" as in it is usually
known in programming languages such as C++ or Java. It is defined by the following grammar:

multi_cmt : MCMTOPN NEWLINE* MCMTCLS ;

In the follow-up, there is a single lined comment starting with "//" which is separated from the
multi-lined comment by a new line which is defined as follows:

single_cmt : SCOMMENT CHARSET* ;

That comment states that global and constant data types are initialised outside the main body.
Apart from the main body, this program consists of a multiple number of functions whose overall
structure is described as:

structure : ((comments | vardec_stmt SEMI) NEWLINE*)* main_body (NEWLINE* functions)* ;

Before the main body, it is possible to put comments, initialise global "$" or constant "%"
variables which can be separated by multiple new lines. It is not mandatory though which is 
expressed by the asterisk "*", standing for zero or many. Having a main body is compulsory but
depending on how the program operates, it is possible to include or exclude functions.

The signature of the main body is always global "$" which is called "$Main init():". Without
including it, this program would not be able to run in the first place:

main_body : GLOBAL MAIN INIT PAROPN PARCLS block ;

But where is the colon ":"? Please note that the main_body includes a parser rule named "block".
A block is a construct holding multiple declarations, statements and methods which is defined as:

block : COLON (block_indent+ | WS+)
 (
 	(iostream | function_call | functions | control_stmt | vardec_stmt | comments)
 	block_indent+
 )* NEWLINE+ ;
 
A block is indented by two whitespaces in NovaLingua:

block_indent : NEWLINE '  '? ;

There is a question mark after the two whitespaces which determines the end of the block. If the
rejects putting these whitespaces after a new line, then the block structure will end.

To start with the main program, it consists of declared local "#" variables and arrays which cover
every permitted data types which are String, Boolean and Decimal. They consist of a scope symbol,
the data type's name and a label. In terms of label, array always have a container enclosed with
two chevrons "<x>" where x determines a numerical value for its capacity. Furthermore, it is
possible to assign "<-" data to them which is enforced by the following parser rule:

vardec_stmt : ((SCOPE VARID)? VARLBL
 	(ASSIGNER
 		(VALUES | ARRAYITEMS | arith_op | function_call | ternary_con)
 	)? COMMA?)* ;
 	
Existing variables do not need to be labelled with a scope and a data type name again but they can
be reassigned by new data as a means to update or replace them. Some variables are declared but
are not initialised which can purposefully be done in later parts of the program. As far as it
concerns the scope types which is comprised of global, local and constant symbols, it must be
taken into consideration that global properties exist throughout all parts of the program whose
data can be altered, local properties can only be accessed and modified within a block structure
and its sub-blocks which can be functions within a function and constant variables which act like
global variables but their data cannot be changed.

After the variable declarions, the program promts the user to input data into the variable message
to output a string. Assuming the user inputs "London" to assign it to message, it would output
"Hello London". The parser rule for that is defined by the following grammars:

iostream : input | output ;
input : IN PAROPN (DECIMAL | STRING) PARCLS ;
output
 : OUT PAROPN (
 (DECIMAL | STRING | arith_op | function_call | ternary_con | reduce_func | calculus_op)
 COMMA?)+ PARCLS ;

This program consists of functions which are assignable to declared variables and callable with
the reserved word "call" in front of the method's label. Function overloading is possible by
putting data inside the actual argument list enclosed with two parenthesis "(variable label)".
Multiple data are separated by a comma. A function call is syntactically defined as:

function_call : CALL FUNCLBL PAROPN actual_argument PARCLS ;
actual_argument : ((VARLBL | DECIMAL | STRING | BOOLEAN | arith_op | function_call) COMMA?)* ;

The function "mathematics()" takes one formal parameter which is number whose initial value is 1.
The most-outer function is alway global which is, in this instance, signified by "$Func". Formal
parameters are not scoped since they are merely copies accessible within that function only whose
existence ceases once the function terminates. Their formal signature is defined as follows:

functions : (GLOBAL | LOCAL) FUNC FUNCLBL PAROPN formal_argument PARCLS block returner? ;
formal_argument : (VARID VARLBL COMMA?)* ;

Functions have blocks like the main body and may have a return statement if their function call
is to be assigned to a variable. "mathematics()" performs mathematical operations which are in
this case multiplication, subtraction, addition and division. The left-most parameter is the
target of an operation whose value is to be altered by the right-most one. Mathematical operations
must always be assigned to a variable as follows:

math_op
 : OPERATORS PAROPN (DECIMAL | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call)
 COMMA (DECIMAL | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call) PARCLS;
 
NovaLingua supports nested methods which can be seen at the newly declared variable "quickMaths"
whose data assigned is the subtraction between the addition of 2 and 2, and 1. The most-inner
method goes first before going a step outside. Speaking of the function, it has a return statement
which assigns the mutated value of number's copy to the main body's number.

The next function "truth()" takes a Boolean parameter whose function runs recursively. It has an
if-else condition ("verify" and "divert" in this language) based on the value of "isTrue". If the
condition is met, it will call the function itself but passes the Boolean value "false" instead of
"isTrue". Once invoked, "isTrue" will hold the value false as formal parameter which in turn will
divert to an alternative path to return false. Since the function's callee receives that value, it
must be taken into consideration that there is a not outside the called function which negates the
false into true. The appropriate parser rules for this methods are:

if_stmt : IF PAROPN condition PARCLS block (ELSE block)? ;
condition : negate_expr | logic_expr | comp_expr | bool_expr ;
negate_expr : NOT PAROPN (condition | function_call | logic_expr | BOOLEAN | VARLBL) PARCLS ;

An if-statement does not necessarily have an else condition but it all depends on the way the user
wants to implement the program. "not()" functions only take one parameter to invert conditions and
Boolean values.

In the function "ultimateNumber()", it is noticeable that its actual parameter takes the addition
of the sum of "constant" and "global", and the "mathematics()" function's return while its return
statement returns a mathematical method. The return statement in NovaLingua is versatile as it can
return the following values based on the grammar defined:

returner : DECIMAL | STRING | VARLBL | arith_op | condition | function_call | ternary_con;
arith_op : math_op | incdec_op ;
math_op : OPERATORS PAROPN (DECIMAL | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call)
 COMMA (DECIMAL | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call) PARCLS;

A special aspect about functions in NovaLingua is shown in the function "mutateNumber()" which
takes the "number" divided by 9. The function starts with a while-loop ("interval" in this
context) whose condition is a logical "and" between checking if "number" is greater than 1 and
checking if "backupNo" is not equal 0. "not(equals(x, y))" is a nested logical condition to
produce a logical "nand". The parser rule for this loop is:

while_loop : WHILE PAROPN condition PARCLS ;
logic_expr
 : LOGIC PAROPN (condition | function_call | BOOLEAN | VARLBL)
 COMMA (condition | function_call | BOOLEAN | VARLBL) PARCLS ;
 
Apart from the logical "and" condition, there is also an "or" condition whose property can be
negated to produce a "nor" statement with the "not()" method.

In the while-loop, there is a switch-case statement ("trigger and choice" in NovaLingua) which
changes the value of "number" based on its value. Switch-case is defined as follows:

switch_case_stmt
 : SWITCH PAROPN VARLBL PARCLS block (CASE (DECIMAL | STRING) block BREAK)*
    DEFAULT block BREAK ;
    
In a switch-case statement, having "break" within each choices and a default choice are compulsory
to leave the control statement. Without it, each choice would be triggered sequentially. Once a
choice has been chosen, it will return to the while-loop to check if "number" is any further
changeable. Once the loop has been exited, it will call a function called "revampFunction()".
What seems to be remarkable about that function is, that it only exists within "mutateNumber()" as
a local function which means it belongs to its main function and cannot be accessed globally other
than by "mutateNumber". Properties from "mutateNumber()" can be accessed by its sub-function but
not the other way around.

The following function called "traverseArray()" will take an array as parameter "capacityArray" to
introduce the for-loops of which there are the natural variant and the for-each-loop. Starting
with the for-each-loop, it will create a local variable called "extractor" to assign each array's
element to it as means to output it. The natural for-loop uses a Decimal as an index, a condition
and either a incrementor or a decrementor as a means to access the array element stored in an
index location. The grammars for this function is defined by the following lexer rules:

for_loop : FOR PAROPN (for_index COMMA for_comp COMMA incdec_op | COLON ARRAY) PARCLS ;
for_index : LOCAL DEC VARLBL ASSIGNER DECIMAL ;
for_comp : COMPARATORS PAROPN VARLBL COMMA (DECIMAL | VARLBL) PARCLS ;
incdec_op : INDECR PAROPN (VARLBL) PARCLS ;

Having covered all the basic features in regards to this programming language, NovaLingua is
offering support for data analysis which includes array slicing and calculus based methods.

Calling the function "arraySlicing()", it is noticeable that the array passed has a boundary "~"
from 1 to 4. This feature is quite useful, if users are only interested in a specific range of
values. In "arraySlicing()"'s sub-function "arrayElementCalculation()", the passed in array's 
boundary has been reduced to produce the total value of each numerical element in the array within
that range. To do so, the use of arrElMerge is required which utilises an anonymous function
("#Anon") whose data type is not known but it has an assigned behaviour marked by the "§" symbol
which can be an arithmetic operator such as "add()" in the example. Array slicing uses the
following grammar:

reduce_func : REDUCE PAROPN lambda_func (math_op | comp_expr) COMMA VARLBL ;
lambda_func : LOCAL LAMBDA VARLBL (COMMA? VARLBL)* MODE ;

The final data analytical feature presented in this language is calculus which is being presented
by the function "algebra()". To initialise a polynomial function, the method mFun() must be used
which assigns a string to the method's name. Since this language is still in an early beta stage,
only one polynomial function can be used. Further calculus operations can be performed such as
solving a function, deriving and integrating it. To solve a function, using the "eval()" method is
quite suitable as it takes two parameters which are the function and an anonymous function to
input x. To derive a function, the "diff()" method must be used which takes the function only as
a parameter. Lastly, to integrate a function, the "ingr()" must be used which takes the function,
an anonymous function which uses the "bnd()" method to substitute x twice as per the parametric
boundaries specified. "ingr()" automatically performs a reversed derivation to perform integral
calculation between the bounds. The function uses the following grammar:

calculus_op : init_func | eval_stmt | diff_stmt | ingr_stmt ;
init_func : INITFUNC PAROPN STRING PARCLS ;
eval_stmt : EVALUATE PAROPN INITFUNC COMMA lambda_func DECIMAL PARCLS ;
diff_stmt : DERIVE PAROPN (INITFUNC | STRING) PARCLS ;
ingr_stmt : INTEGRATE PAROPN INITFUNC COMMA lambda_func boundary PARCLS ;
boundary : BOUND PAROPN DECIMAL COMMA DECIMAL PARCLS ;

To finish the program, it will conclude with a ternary assignment to the newly declared Decimal
variable named "versus" which checks whether "global" is greater than "novaNumero" to decide,
whether it will copy the value of global or novaNumero. The grammar for it is as follows:

// ternary condition
ternary_con
 : PAROPN condition PARCLS QM (DECIMAL | STRING | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call)
 COLON (DECIMAL | STRING | VARLBL | arith_op | function_call) ;
 
As this language is a completely new programming language, it will help data analysts to reap the
fruits of NovaLingua in the near future with further features to come.
